# Aliens-vs-Earth
 
This project is called Aliens-vs-Earth because I initially started this project besides my education but because I was making stuff during the pre-flight assignement that I could also use in this project I kept working in it. So far you can find a cinemachine camera controller to switch between all the different player persepctives. I included this in the project for my extending software assignment I chose cinemachine because it seemed very nice to master camera's more in general.
You can also find an thirdperson and first person character controller in this project who can parkour around and eliminate enemy's in the game. All the stuff in this project where made by me alone, I worked on this project for a few months now! you can read more about this project on my portfolio website:

I am still planning to make more and more in this project and I will keep expanding it until the game is complete, So far I can say i'm very proud of what I've made during these past few months. You can download the project too if you want to check it out.
